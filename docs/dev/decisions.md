# Decisions

Durable product and architecture decisions, newest last. Each records what was
decided, the options considered and why.

## 2026-10-04 — D0: Name and licence

Flashheart (after the Blackadder character), binary `flashheart`, repository
`~/src/Flashheart`. MIT licence, Robert Taylor as copyright holder. The working
name AIshape was dropped before any code.

## 2026-10-04 — D1: Observe and coordinate; do not launch agents

Options: watch agents the user runs in their own apps; launch agents from the
board (as Vibe Kanban, Kagan and Kanbots do); both.

Decision: observe and coordinate. Launchers are an established category;
nothing yet gives one view of the sessions people already run in Claude Code
and Codex, with durable handoffs between them. The agent apps keep owning
sessions, credentials and permissions. Launching is a later possibility.

## 2026-10-04 — D2: Markdown tickets plus an append-only event log

Options: markdown only; markdown tickets and a JSONL event log; SQLite with
markdown export.

Decision: tickets stay markdown (readable in Obsidian, diffable, usable without
Flashheart); high-volume run activity goes to per-project daily JSONL files.
`serve` builds an in-memory index at start and keeps no database. Durable
meaning (handoffs, answers) is written into tickets so the log is disposable.

## 2026-10-04 — D3: A ticket's column is its directory (superseded by D15)

Options: directory (kanban-tracker format); a `status:` field.

Decision: directory. It keeps compatibility with the existing skill and with
Obsidian, and a move is a rename. Agent state lives on runs, so tickets need no
extra AI states. Adds `done/`. Virtual columns (Needs you, Agent working) are
computed and never stored.

## 2026-10-04 — D4: One binary, three modes, no required daemon

Options: every mode writes files through a shared store with locks; a daemon
that all writers go through.

Decision: `serve`, `mcp` and `hook` each use the same store package directly,
with a per-project advisory lock, atomic writes and content-hash
preconditions. Agents must work when the UI is closed, and hooks must not
depend on Singleserve authentication. `serve` watches the files.

## 2026-10-04 — D5: Hooks first, MCP for meaning, instructions last

Options considered for keeping the board current: model instructions only;
MCP tools; hooks; passive reading of agent session logs.

Decision: hooks carry every lifecycle fact deterministically; MCP tools carry
only what the model knows; the protocol skill explains the tools; an opt-in
Stop hook enforces a handoff after edits. Passive session-log reading is
deferred: formats change without notice and logs contain secrets.

## 2026-10-04 — D6: Project from the main checkout; ticket by claim

Project name is the main checkout's directory name (worktree-safe). Runs link
to tickets by explicit claim, provisionally by branch match, and subagents
inherit. Unlinked runs show as Unassigned rather than being guessed.

## 2026-10-04 — D7: A small MCP tool set

About ten tools with compact outputs and no delete. Remote MCP (ordinary
ChatGPT chat connectors) is rejected to stay local-only; Codex covers the
ChatGPT side as a coding agent.

## 2026-10-04 — D8: A separate Agents view plus virtual columns

Options: extra workflow columns for AI states; a separate run-state view.

Decision: run state is a different axis from workflow status. The Agents view
shows runs in lanes (Working, Needs you, Waiting, Quiet, Ended); the board gets
live badges and toggleable virtual columns (Needs you, Agent working).

## 2026-10-04 — D9: Setup shows a diff and writes only with --write

`flashheart setup <agent>` prints the exact configuration changes and writes
them only with `--write`, with backups, owning only its own entries. Editing a
user's agent configuration silently is not acceptable.

## 2026-10-04 — D10: Libraries

Go: `github.com/rztaylor/singleserve` v0.2.x; `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`
(official, v1.7+); `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify`; `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3` for
YAML with node-level round-tripping; a small cross-platform file-lock library
or `golang.org/x/sys`. Frontend: React,
strict TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, `@dnd-kit` (accessible drag and
drop), `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` without raw HTML; Biome, Vitest,
Playwright. Commodity parsing, drag and drop and markdown are not
hand-written.

## 2026-10-04 — D11: Safety model

Writes confined to the root; `attach` copies allow-listed types under a size
limit; hooks store names and scrubbed short summaries only; agent-written text
is data for other agents; no network beyond loopback.

## 2026-10-04 — D12: Board root outside repositories

Default root `~/reports/Kanban`, one subdirectory per project, so the board is
the user's own and is not committed into the repositories it tracks.
Overridable with `--root` or `FLASHHEART_ROOT`. Whether the root is itself a
git repository is left to the user for now.

Confirmed at `foundation` (2026-10-04): `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3` (v3.0.5, maintained
by the YAML organisation) rather than `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, whose last release
was v3.0.1 in May 2022 and whose repository is archived. The API is the same.
Singleserve is pinned at v0.2.2, which requires Go 1.26.6.

## 2026-10-04 — D13: `serve` detaches from the terminal

Options: block the terminal until the server stops (Singleserve's example
shape); detach after launching the browser; a separate long-lived daemon.

Decision: detach. `flashheart` re-executes itself as a child in a new session
with discarded standard streams and waits on a one-line startup handshake (an
inherited pipe) until the server is listening and the browser launch was
attempted. The launcher prints the manual URL if the browser could not be
opened, then exits 0. The child keeps the browser-bound lifetime, so Quit or
closing the last tab stops it. `--foreground` keeps the old blocking shape for
debugging and tests. Singleserve leaves detached startup to the consumer's CLI
boundary, so it lives in `internal/background` and `internal/cli`. After the
handshake the child writes diagnostics (later errors, the standard logger used
by `net/http`, `--debug` summaries) to `<root>/.flashheart/serve.log`, created
on first write and rotated at 1 MB; a crash that bypasses Go's logger is still
lost, and `--foreground` shows everything.

## 2026-10-04 — D14: Board visual direction: Transit Line Map

Options (impeccable decision page, code-led because no image generation is
available locally): Transit Line Map (assigned by the concept roll), Flight
Progress Strips, Terminal Yellow Wayfinding, the category-standard kanban,
and five declined challengers.

Decision: Transit Line Map, chosen by the user. The structure stays a
standard kanban (the user pinned "standard kanban, but with style"); the
world supplies type, palette, density and one signature move: workstreams as
transit lines with tickets as stations. Line colours are reserved for
workstreams so they always mean the same thing; ticket state uses ink,
shape and words, which also keeps colour off the critical path for
accessibility. Waits on an earlier station are shown quietly so the blocked
diamond answers "what is stuck". Frontend additions under D10: self-hosted
`@fontsource-variable/archivo` (OFL) for the signage grotesk under the
strict CSP, and an authored icon set instead of an icon library.

## 2026-10-05 — D15: Board format v2: a folder per ticket, status in frontmatter

Context: the kanban-tracker skill will be replaced by Flashheart and Obsidian
is not in use, so compatibility with the v1 column-folder layout no longer
constrains the format (user, 2026-10-05). The board also needs a new column
(Up next) and a home for files agents refer to.

Options: keep column folders and add ids; a flat `tickets/` folder with the
status in frontmatter; a folder per ticket with the status in frontmatter.

Decision: a folder per ticket (`tickets/FH-42-<slug>/` holding `FH-42-<slug>.md`,
`review.md` and `files/`) with the column as a frontmatter `status`. Moves
become a field edit under the lock with a hash precondition instead of a
rename that races other writers; columns are a list rather than folders, so
Up next costs nothing; archiving or copying a ticket carries its review and
files with it; and a ticket's files can be copied in before agents clean
theirs up (REV-5). Tickets stay plain markdown. The columns are Backlog, Up
next, In progress, Ready to review and Done; v1 boards convert once with
`flashheart migrate`, which moves the old tree into a backup inside the root.
Supersedes D3 and the kanban-tracker compatibility in STO-1.

## 2026-10-05 — D16: JIRA-style ticket ids

Decision: every project has a short key (`FH`) in `project.yaml` and every
ticket an id `FH-42` in its frontmatter, assigned from `next_id` under the
project lock and never reused. The id lives in the file so it is greppable and
visible to agents reading files directly. Ids name tickets everywhere (UI,
URLs, events, MCP, dependencies), and because keys are unique across the
root, ids need no project prefix. Existing tickets are numbered once, oldest
first, by `flashheart migrate`. With `list_tickets` (MCP-7) and the caller's
project known from its working directory, a user can ask an agent for "the
three top-priority bugs" or "FH-42" in plain words.

Keys are chosen before a project's first ticket and then fixed (KEY-5).
Agents choose them, since they know what the project is called in
conversation: `board_context` asks while the key is unset and
`set_project_key` records it under a root-wide lock, so two new projects
cannot take the same key. The ticket file is named after its folder
(`FH-42-<slug>.md`) so editor tabs and search results identify the ticket
(user, 2026-10-05).
